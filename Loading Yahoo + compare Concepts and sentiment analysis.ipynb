Or simply a money issue?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  c) has the centralising nature of the British state led to unnecessary delays compared to other countries? This seems most clear with PHE and refusal to use private labs for testing but there are also stories of multiple other offers of private help being ignored/rejected.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  d) linked to this there seems to be a lack of trust in Whitehall about how people will respond to information. We saw this in concerns about communicating the lockdown; and now with masks. This seems to have repeatedly slowed down action.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  (How the centralisation at the core of the UK political system leads to a breakdown in trust between government; services and the public is a huge topic that I've become increasingly fascinated by but does seem to have some relevance here).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Finally e) we seem to have a significant error in allowing infected patients back into care-homes. Was this just a capacity issue linked to b) or a function of the low status that social care has in the UK? (And tbf in many other countries).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  I’m going to go out on a limb and say there’s something wrong with our treatment protocol. Without the NHS being swamped, we are getting a 33% death rate in hospital.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Even basing it on SARS would have been wrong. The evidence is mounting that this is more than just a respiratory disease. See this twitter.com/toad_spotted/s… twitter.com/toad_spotted/s…\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  What can explain death rates like this?

Pues, como siempre, tranquilidad pero mucha, mucha, precaución\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Lo primero es que la cosa va por provincias, hasta por ciudades. No tiene nada que ver el número de infectados en Canarias (2200) que en Madrid (casi 62000), ni mucho menos el número de casos nuevos. Datos y mapa actualizado y detallado aquí\\ncovid19.isciii.es pic.twitter.com/EIIXu8F5wl\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  La realidad es que todavía hay muchas personas infectadas y sabemos, lamentablemente, que también hay casos no diagnosticados (personas poco sintomáticas, asintomáticas, que no se ha realizado la PCR, etc.). Todas esas personas pueden transmitir la enfermedad todavía\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Y tampoco tenemos de momento un tratamiento que sepamos que sea eficaz para el virus ni podemos determinar con certeza quién tendrá complicaciones graves o no. Sabemos mucho más que hace 2 meses, pero estamos lejos de saberlo todo. Estamos investigando, pero nos falta mucho\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Lo podemos explicar como si te atropella un coche a toda velocidad... no le puedes ver ni la matrícula, probablemente apenas sepas el color. Ahora estamos empezando a ver las fotos que hemos podido tomar (los datos recogidos) y preparando nuevas cámaras. Sabremos más. Todavía no\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Y las cifras de mortalidad de los pacientes que ingresan en el hospital asustan. Mucho. Se acaba de publicar una mortalidad superior al 30% en pacientes ingresados en Reino Unido. Muchos pacientes que ingresan en el hospital por COVID19 fallecen. Es así\\nmedrxiv.org/content/10.110…\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Por tanto, si el virus sigue entre nosotros y hay tantos casos, si seguimos sin saber mucho del virus y si la mortalidad en pacientes graves es TAN alta. ¿Qué vamos a hacer? ¿No es una locura que salgamos a la calle? Pues sí y no. Todo hay que hacerlo con cabeza y pensando\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Sería una locura considerando lo que hemos dicho pero esto hay que balancearlo con intentar ir saliendo del confinamiento, que también tiene efectos secundarios.Y hay que intentar recuperar la actividad \"medio normal\". Es necesario tomar el sol, pasear, evitar la inmovilidad,etc.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  También es necesario reactivar la economía pero estoy seguro que TODOS pensamos que no podemos poner precio en muertos a un % del PIB. Si alguien piensa lo contrario, que piense que puede pasarle a él o a su familia. O \"sacrificarse\", como sugerían aquí 🤦\\u200d♂️\\nrealclearpolitics.com/video/2020/03/…\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Y no, tampoco podemos \"coexistir\" con el virus hasta alcanzar la inmunidad de grupo. Dicho en plata, quedan MUCHOS MUERTOS hasta la inmunidad de grupo, así que espero que nadie piense que esta es la mejor opción ni siquiera una posibilidad (excepto que NO tengamos vacuna)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  ¿Lo ideal qué sería? Conseguir la transmisión cero, eliminar el virus. Esto es difícil a corto plazo incluso con confinamiento estricto, pero parece que se está consiguiendo en China y Corea. Espero que con medidas de control contactos, tests, lo logremos\\ntheguardian.com/world/2020/apr…\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Y mientras tanto, ¿qué tenemos que hacer? Pues muchísima precaución, sobre todo la gente mayor o con factores de riesgo ¡¡pero siempre recordando que tenemos gente de 30 y 40 años ingresada grave!! Distanciamiento social estricto, lavado de manos, evitar reuniones, etc.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Es decir, se desescala el confinamiento pero el virus sigue aquí, seguimos sin saber claramente cómo tratarlo y aunque mucha gente lo pasa sin enterarse o tiene síntomas leves, el que tiene que ingresar lo pasa MAL e, incluso, puede fallecer. Así que mucha precaución, por favor\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  El sistema sanitario ya no está colapsado, pero todavía está organizándose con mucha dificultad para gestionar los pacientes COVID19 y los \"no COVID\", que también hay que atender (nota: no vayáis al hospital o al centro de salud si no es imprescindible, haré otro hilo de esto)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Pero aunque no estemos colapsados seguimos sin poder manejar adecuadamente el virus. Tendremos respuesta para muchos interrogantes en las próximos meses, pero es imposible aprender a tratar una enfermedad tan nueva y tan diferente en tan poco tiempo. Lleva más tiempo\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Es decir, el que ahora se infecte del virus puede complicarse y, aunque el sistema sanitario esté operativo, puede complicarse MUCHO. No queremos que nadie se infecte, así que tened mucho, pero que mucho cuidado. Repito, mortalidad > 30% en ingresados\\nmedrxiv.org/content/10.110…\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  ¿Y nunca vamos a volver a la normalidad? Por supuesto que sí... cuando tengamos la vacuna. Mientras tanto según como evolucione el virus se irán levantando restricciones y probablemente se podrá viajar dentro de España y un tiempo dentro de Europa (no me atrevo a dar fechas)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Viajar a países que no tengan tan controlado el virus o que no sepamos qué ocurre, como países con menos recursos, será más complicado y costará más que pueda normalizarse. China bloquea la llegada de extranjeros... cómo dan la vuelta las cosas\\nnytimes.com/2020/03/26/wor…\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Y algo que ayudará probablemente en España es el sol, ese sol que todavía no ha llegado a buena parte de la península y que, aunque no está claro cómo ni cuánto, puede disminuir un poco la transmisión del virus. Así que a ver si llega pronto el solecito y nos echa una mano\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Termino ya: tranquilidad porque estamos mejor y vamos por el buen camino pero PRECISAMENTE es muy importante que no se tuerza. Distanciamiento social, lavado de manos, mascarilla, evitar reuniones y, sobre todo, no olvidarse de que el #COVID19 está aquí y es un mal bicho\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Recordemos que con la gripe de 1918 hubo varios picos, muy peligrosos todos ellos. No estamos libres de que vuelva a ocurrir otra ola de COVID19 así que por favor tenedlo presente.

Se acaba de publicar una mortalidad superior al 30% en pacientes ingresados en Reino Unido. Muchos pacientes que ingresan en el hospital por COVID19 fallecen. Es así\\nmedrxiv.org/content/10.110…\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Por tanto, si el virus sigue entre nosotros y hay tantos casos, si seguimos sin saber mucho del virus y si la mortalidad en pacientes graves es TAN alta. ¿Qué vamos a hacer? ¿No es una locura que salgamos a la calle? Pues sí y no. Todo hay que hacerlo con cabeza y pensando\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Sería una locura considerando lo que hemos dicho pero esto hay que balancearlo con intentar ir saliendo del confinamiento, que también tiene efectos secundarios.Y hay que intentar recuperar la actividad \"medio normal\". Es necesario tomar el sol, pasear, evitar la inmovilidad,etc.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  También es necesario reactivar la economía pero estoy seguro que TODOS pensamos que no podemos poner precio en muertos a un % del PIB. Si alguien piensa lo contrario, que piense que puede pasarle a él o a su familia. O \"sacrificarse\", como sugerían aquí 🤦\\u200d♂️\\nrealclearpolitics.com/video/2020/03/…\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Y no, tampoco podemos \"coexistir\" con el virus hasta alcanzar la inmunidad de grupo. Dicho en plata, quedan MUCHOS MUERTOS hasta la inmunidad de grupo, así que espero que nadie piense que esta es la mejor opción ni siquiera una posibilidad (excepto que NO tengamos vacuna)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  ¿Lo ideal qué sería? Conseguir la transmisión cero, eliminar el virus. Esto es difícil a corto plazo incluso con confinamiento estricto, pero parece que se está consiguiendo en China y Corea. Espero que con medidas de control contactos, tests, lo logremos\\ntheguardian.com/world/2020/apr…\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Y mientras tanto, ¿qué tenemos que hacer? Pues muchísima precaución, sobre todo la gente mayor o con factores de riesgo ¡¡pero siempre recordando que tenemos gente de 30 y 40 años ingresada grave!! Distanciamiento social estricto, lavado de manos, evitar reuniones, etc.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Es decir, se desescala el confinamiento pero el virus sigue aquí, seguimos sin saber claramente cómo tratarlo y aunque mucha gente lo pasa sin enterarse o tiene síntomas leves, el que tiene que ingresar lo pasa MAL e, incluso, puede fallecer. Así que mucha precaución, por favor\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  El sistema sanitario ya no está colapsado, pero todavía está organizándose con mucha dificultad para gestionar los pacientes COVID19 y los \"no COVID\", que también hay que atender (nota: no vayáis al hospital o al centro de salud si no es imprescindible, haré otro hilo de esto)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Pero aunque no estemos colapsados seguimos sin poder manejar adecuadamente el virus. Tendremos respuesta para muchos interrogantes en las próximos meses, pero es imposible aprender a tratar una enfermedad tan nueva y tan diferente en tan poco tiempo. Lleva más tiempo\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Es decir, el que ahora se infecte del virus puede complicarse y, aunque el sistema sanitario esté operativo, puede complicarse MUCHO. No queremos que nadie se infecte, así que tened mucho, pero que mucho cuidado. Repito, mortalidad > 30% en ingresados\\nmedrxiv.org/content/10.110…\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  ¿Y nunca vamos a volver a la normalidad? Por supuesto que sí... cuando tengamos la vacuna. Mientras tanto según como evolucione el virus se irán levantando restricciones y probablemente se podrá viajar dentro de España y un tiempo dentro de Europa (no me atrevo a dar fechas)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Viajar a países que no tengan tan controlado el virus o que no sepamos qué ocurre, como países con menos recursos, será más complicado y costará más que pueda normalizarse. China bloquea la llegada de extranjeros... cómo dan la vuelta las cosas\\nnytimes.com/2020/03/26/wor…\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Y algo que ayudará probablemente en España es el sol, ese sol que todavía no ha llegado a buena parte de la península y que, aunque no está claro cómo ni cuánto, puede disminuir un poco la transmisión del virus. Así que a ver si llega pronto el solecito y nos echa una mano\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Termino ya: tranquilidad porque estamos mejor y vamos por el buen camino pero PRECISAMENTE es muy importante que no se tuerza. Distanciamiento social, lavado de manos, mascarilla, evitar reuniones y, sobre todo, no olvidarse de que el #COVID19 está aquí y es un mal bicho\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Recordemos que con la gripe de 1918 hubo varios picos, muy peligrosos todos ellos. No estamos libres de que vuelva a ocurrir otra ola de COVID19 así que por favor tenedlo presente.

And has remained steady at about 0.8 since the start of April. Is that really in line with what you'd expect from a SIR model that's reached herd immunity?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Surely, if herd immunity was responsible for the falling deaths, R would also be steadily reducing over time? Rather than being stuck at 0.8-ish?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Where are you getting this R from? It peaked before lockdown & has been going down ever since. That by definition says the rate of infection is below 1. It doesn’t need to be below 1 when it’s so near the end it can’t hit the peak again. It’s bullshit\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Calculated from various data sources (ONS COVID & excess death data, NHS England death data, hospital admissions, ICU admissions etc). It fell throughout March, but has been pretty constant since then.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  It’s not. Been falling constantly. Daily deaths been falling constantly when shown by date of death. cebm.net/covid-19/covid… lockdown’s just delaying it falling to the bottom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Deaths have been falling since early April. Deaths follow infections by 2-3 weeks, so that corresponds to new infections falling since late March. Which corresponds to R being less than 1 since late March.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Nope. Average time from infection to death 21 days. Some say longer. NHS calls, ambulance attendances, etc all back up it peaking well before lockdown. Wouldn’t have peaked on different dates if lockdown. Sweden 0.04% death rate per capita & nearing the end. UK over 0.05%.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Which sources are you using for 21 days?

Early research suggests the coronavirus is mild in four out of five cases, however, it can trigger a respiratory disease called COVID-19. The coronavirus is thought to have emerged at a seafood and live animal market in the Chinese city Wuhan, capital of Hubei province, at the end of 2019. Only the relatively small number of people worldwide who have encountered the infection are said to be immune to it. While anyone can catch the coronavirus, complications and fatalities seem to be disproportionately high among the obese.

These conditions include high blood pressure, excess fat around the waist and elevated “bad” cholesterol. Writing in the journal Nature Reviews Endocrinology, scientists from University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus in Germany said “patients with [type 2 diabetes] and metabolic syndrome might have up to 10-times greater risk of death when they contract COVID-19”. Statistics show the vast majority of the deaths worldwide are in the elderly or those with pre-existing health conditions. Even after adjusting for other medical problems, the UK hospital study found being obese was a significant risk factor for death. “This may be because as your infection progresses and the virus infects more and more cells, the demand for oxygen in the tissues is much higher for an obese individual than it is for a lean individual,” said Dr Dyan Sellayah from the University of Reading.  “Eventually the obese body becomes overwhelmed by the lack of oxygen getting to the major organs.” Although usually mild, the coronavirus can spread from the airways to the alveoli (air sacs) in the lungs, where gas exchange takes place. The air sacs then become inflamed and filled with fluid or pus. As the lungs struggle to draw in air, oxygen levels in the blood fall and carbon dioxide accumulates.\n",

Obese people having a “higher metabolic demand” may not tell the full story, however. “Obese people tend to have dysfunctional immune systems; their fat tissue for example becomes a reservoir for immune cells known as macrophages,” said Dr Sellayah.  “While these cells reside in our fat under normal circumstances, in obesity they are at higher frequency and become more troublesome. “They start to secrete inflammatory cytokines [immune-fighting proteins], and negatively impact on immune and metabolic health.  “It is likely the immune response to the virus is therefore ineffective in obese individuals”. Cytokines are released to help regulate immunity. Excessive amounts can lead to a “cytokine storm”, which triggers hyper-inflammation. Obese people may also have reduced lung function, making it harder to draw in oxygen. While the coronavirus is relatively new, excess weight has been shown to be dangerous with flu. In 2009, 61% of the people hospitalised with swine flu in California who later died from the infection were obese. Obese adults have also been found to “carry” flu viruses for 42% longer than their slimmer counterparts.\n",
      "ARTICLE: Obesity has been highlighted as one of the biggest risk factors for complications amid the coronavirus outbreak. In the largest study in Europe so far, data from more than 16,000 patients across 166 UK hospitals revealed carrying a dangerous amount of weight, old age and being male all raise the risk of dying with the infection. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that out of around 180 adults hospitalised with the coronavirus, 89% had at least one underlying condition, with obesity being the most common for those between 18 and 64. Just under a third (29%) of UK adults were classified as obese in 2019. In the US, 42% of people of all ages carried a dangerous amount of weight in 2017/18. Early research suggests the coronavirus is mild in four out of five cases, however, it can trigger a respiratory disease called COVID-19. The coronavirus is thought to have emerged at a seafood and live animal market in the Chinese city Wuhan, capital of Hubei province, at the end of 2019. Only the relatively small number of people worldwide who have encountered the infection are said to be immune to it. While anyone can catch the coronavirus, complications and fatalities seem to be disproportionately high among the obese.

Cytokines are released to help regulate immunity. Excessive amounts can lead to a “cytokine storm”, which triggers hyper-inflammation. Obese people may also have reduced lung function, making it harder to draw in oxygen. While the coronavirus is relatively new, excess weight has been shown to be dangerous with flu. In 2009, 61% of the people hospitalised with swine flu in California who later died from the infection were obese. Obese adults have also been found to “carry” flu viruses for 42% longer than their slimmer counterparts. According to the cardiologist Dr Aseem Malhotra, the “root of it all is poor diet”. “If you have a poor diet [and] excess body fat, you have chronic inflammation in the body; it’s under stress and being damaged,” he said. Speaking on BBC Sounds, he specifically blamed ultra-processed food, which reportedly makes up around half of the average person’s daily calorie intake. “If it comes out of a packet and it has five or more ingredients, it’s ultra processed,” said Dr Malhotra. While combating the obesity problem amid a pandemic may seem unrealistic, the medic claimed dietary tweaks can bring about results surprisingly quickly. Dr Malhotra claimed some of his patients have reversed their type 2 diabetes in just 21 days following years of medication. “If everyone [cut out ultra-processed food] just for a month, up to 50% of people could send their type 2 diabetes into remission and would be in a much better state to deal with COVID-19”, he said. Dr Malhotra recommended cutting back on sugar and starchy carbohydrates, like rice, pasta, bread and potatoes.\n",
      "ARTICLE: Obesity has been highlighted as one of the biggest risk factors for complications amid the coronavirus outbreak. In the largest study in Europe so far, data from more than 16,000 patients across 166 UK hospitals revealed carrying a dangerous amount of weight, old age and being male all raise the risk of dying with the infection. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that out of around 180 adults hospitalised with the coronavirus, 89% had at least one underlying condition, with obesity being the most common for those between 18 and 64. Just under a third (29%) of UK adults were classified as obese in 2019. In the US, 42% of people of all ages carried a dangerous amount of weight in 2017/18. Early research suggests the coronavirus is mild in four out of five cases, however, it can trigger a respiratory disease called COVID-19. The coronavirus is thought to have emerged at a seafood and live animal market in the Chinese city Wuhan, capital of Hubei province, at the end of 2019. Only the relatively small number of people worldwide who have encountered the infection are said to be immune to it. While anyone can catch the coronavirus, complications and fatalities seem to be disproportionately high among the obese.

These conditions include high blood pressure, excess fat around the waist and elevated “bad” cholesterol. Writing in the journal Nature Reviews Endocrinology, scientists from University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus in Germany said “patients with [type 2 diabetes] and metabolic syndrome might have up to 10-times greater risk of death when they contract COVID-19”. Statistics show the vast majority of the deaths worldwide are in the elderly or those with pre-existing health conditions. Even after adjusting for other medical problems, the UK hospital study found being obese was a significant risk factor for death. “This may be because as your infection progresses and the virus infects more and more cells, the demand for oxygen in the tissues is much higher for an obese individual than it is for a lean individual,” said Dr Dyan Sellayah from the University of Reading.  “Eventually the obese body becomes overwhelmed by the lack of oxygen getting to the major organs.” Although usually mild, the coronavirus can spread from the airways to the alveoli (air sacs) in the lungs, where gas exchange takes place. The air sacs then become inflamed and filled with fluid or pus. As the lungs struggle to draw in air, oxygen levels in the blood fall and carbon dioxide accumulates.

Latest coronavirus news, updates and advice Live: Follow all the latest updates from the UK and around the world Fact-checker: The number of COVID-19 cases in your local area Explained: Symptoms, latest advice and how it compares to the flu Carrying too much weight can also lead to metabolic syndrome; a cluster of conditions that raise the risk of type 2 diabetes, stroke and heart disease. These conditions include high blood pressure, excess fat around the waist and elevated “bad” cholesterol. Writing in the journal Nature Reviews Endocrinology, scientists from University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus in Germany said “patients with [type 2 diabetes] and metabolic syndrome might have up to 10-times greater risk of death when they contract COVID-19”. Statistics show the vast majority of the deaths worldwide are in the elderly or those with pre-existing health conditions. Even after adjusting for other medical problems, the UK hospital study found being obese was a significant risk factor for death. “This may be because as your infection progresses and the virus infects more and more cells, the demand for oxygen in the tissues is much higher for an obese individual than it is for a lean individual,” said Dr Dyan Sellayah from the University of Reading.  “Eventually the obese body becomes overwhelmed by the lack of oxygen getting to the major organs.” Although usually mild, the coronavirus can spread from the airways to the alveoli (air sacs) in the lungs, where gas exchange takes place. The air sacs then become inflamed and filled with fluid or pus. As the lungs struggle to draw in air, oxygen levels in the blood fall and carbon dioxide accumulates. Obese people having a “higher metabolic demand” may not tell the full story, however. “Obese people tend to have dysfunctional immune systems; their fat tissue for example becomes a reservoir for immune cells known as macrophages,” said Dr Sellayah.  “While these cells reside in our fat under normal circumstances, in obesity they are at higher frequency and become more troublesome. “They start to secrete inflammatory cytokines [immune-fighting proteins], and negatively impact on immune and metabolic health.  “It is likely the immune response to the virus is therefore ineffective in obese individuals”. Cytokines are released to help regulate immunity. Excessive amounts can lead to a “cytokine storm”, which triggers hyper-inflammation. Obese people may also have reduced lung function, making it harder to draw in oxygen. While the coronavirus is relatively new, excess weight has been shown to be dangerous with flu. In 2009, 61% of the people hospitalised with swine flu in California who later died from the infection were obese. Obese adults have also been found to “carry” flu viruses for 42% longer than their slimmer counterparts. According to the cardiologist Dr Aseem Malhotra, the “root of it all is poor diet”. “If you have a poor diet [and] excess body fat, you have chronic inflammation in the body; it’s under stress and being damaged,” he said. Speaking on BBC Sounds, he specifically blamed ultra-processed food, which reportedly makes up around half of the average person’s daily calorie intake. “If it comes out of a packet and it has five or more ingredients, it’s ultra processed,” said Dr Malhotra. While combating the obesity problem amid a pandemic may seem unrealistic, the medic claimed dietary tweaks can bring about results surprisingly quickly. Dr Malhotra claimed some of his patients have reversed their type 2 diabetes in just 21 days following years of medication. “If everyone [cut out ultra-processed food] just for a month, up to 50% of people could send their type 2 diabetes into remission and would be in a much better state to deal with COVID-19”, he said. Dr Malhotra recommended cutting back on sugar and starchy carbohydrates, like rice, pasta, bread and potatoes. Instead, he advised our diets be made up of vegetables, whole fruit, oily fish, meat, dairy and nuts. This slightly contradicts the NHS Eat Well recommendations, which encourage five portions of fruit or vegetables a day, but also states meals should be based on “higher fibre starchy foods”. While junk food has become “normalised”, Dr Malhotra stressed it is addictive and does not satisfy hunger. Many claim fresh food is inexpensive, however, the medic stressed “an apple costs less than a chocolate bar”. The coronavirus is one of seven strains of a virus class that are known to infect humans. Others cause everything from the common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), which killed 774 people during its 2002/3 outbreak. Since the outbreak was identified, more than 3.5 million cases have been confirmed worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University.\n",
      "ARTICLE: Obesity has been highlighted as one of the biggest risk factors for complications amid the coronavirus outbreak. In the largest study in Europe so far, data from more than 16,000 patients across 166 UK hospitals revealed carrying a dangerous amount of weight, old age and being male all raise the risk of dying with the infection. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that out of around 180 adults hospitalised with the coronavirus, 89% had at least one underlying condition, with obesity being the most common for those between 18 and 64. Just under a third (29%) of UK adults were classified as obese in 2019. In the US, 42% of people of all ages carried a dangerous amount of weight in 2017/18. Early research suggests the coronavirus is mild in four out of five cases, however, it can trigger a respiratory disease called COVID-19. The coronavirus is thought to have emerged at a seafood and live animal market in the Chinese city Wuhan, capital of Hubei province, at the end of 2019.

The coronavirus is thought to have emerged at a seafood and live animal market in the Chinese city Wuhan, capital of Hubei province, at the end of 2019. Only the relatively small number of people worldwide who have encountered the infection are said to be immune to it. While anyone can catch the coronavirus, complications and fatalities seem to be disproportionately high among the obese.

These conditions include high blood pressure, excess fat around the waist and elevated “bad” cholesterol. Writing in the journal Nature Reviews Endocrinology, scientists from University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus in Germany said “patients with [type 2 diabetes] and metabolic syndrome might have up to 10-times greater risk of death when they contract COVID-19”. Statistics show the vast majority of the deaths worldwide are in the elderly or those with pre-existing health conditions. Even after adjusting for other medical problems, the UK hospital study found being obese was a significant risk factor for death. “This may be because as your infection progresses and the virus infects more and more cells, the demand for oxygen in the tissues is much higher for an obese individual than it is for a lean individual,” said Dr Dyan Sellayah from the University of Reading.  “Eventually the obese body becomes overwhelmed by the lack of oxygen getting to the major organs.” Although usually mild, the coronavirus can spread from the airways to the alveoli (air sacs) in the lungs, where gas exchange takes place. The air sacs then become inflamed and filled with fluid or pus. As the lungs struggle to draw in air, oxygen levels in the blood fall and carbon dioxide accumulates. Obese people having a “higher metabolic demand” may not tell the full story, however. “Obese people tend to have dysfunctional immune systems; their fat tissue for example becomes a reservoir for immune cells known as macrophages,” said Dr Sellayah.  “While these cells reside in our fat under normal circumstances, in obesity they are at higher frequency and become more troublesome. “They start to secrete inflammatory cytokines [immune-fighting proteins], and negatively impact on immune and metabolic health.  “It is likely the immune response to the virus is therefore ineffective in obese individuals”. Cytokines are released to help regulate immunity. Excessive amounts can lead to a “cytokine storm”, which triggers hyper-inflammation. Obese people may also have reduced lung function, making it harder to draw in oxygen. While the coronavirus is relatively new, excess weight has been shown to be dangerous with flu. In 2009, 61% of the people hospitalised with swine flu in California who later died from the infection were obese. Obese adults have also been found to “carry” flu viruses for 42% longer than their slimmer counterparts. According to the cardiologist Dr Aseem Malhotra, the “root of it all is poor diet”. “If you have a poor diet [and] excess body fat, you have chronic inflammation in the body; it’s under stress and being damaged,” he said. Speaking on BBC Sounds, he specifically blamed ultra-processed food, which reportedly makes up around half of the average person’s daily calorie intake. “If it comes out of a packet and it has five or more ingredients, it’s ultra processed,” said Dr Malhotra. While combating the obesity problem amid a pandemic may seem unrealistic, the medic claimed dietary tweaks can bring about results surprisingly quickly. Dr Malhotra claimed some of his patients have reversed their type 2 diabetes in just 21 days following years of medication. “If everyone [cut out ultra-processed food] just for a month, up to 50% of people could send their type 2 diabetes into remission and would be in a much better state to deal with COVID-19”, he said. Dr Malhotra recommended cutting back on sugar and starchy carbohydrates, like rice, pasta, bread and potatoes. Instead, he advised our diets be made up of vegetables, whole fruit, oily fish, meat, dairy and nuts. This slightly contradicts the NHS Eat Well recommendations, which encourage five portions of fruit or vegetables a day, but also states meals should be based on “higher fibre starchy foods”. While junk food has become “normalised”, Dr Malhotra stressed it is addictive and does not satisfy hunger. Many claim fresh food is inexpensive, however, the medic stressed “an apple costs less than a chocolate bar”. The coronavirus is one of seven strains of a virus class that are known to infect humans. Others cause everything from the common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), which killed 774 people during its 2002/3 outbreak. Since the outbreak was identified, more than 3.5 million cases have been confirmed worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University. Of these cases, over 1.1 million are known to have “recovered”.

      "ARTICLE: Obesity has been highlighted as one of the biggest risk factors for complications amid the coronavirus outbreak. In the largest study in Europe so far, data from more than 16,000 patients across 166 UK hospitals revealed carrying a dangerous amount of weight, old age and being male all raise the risk of dying with the infection. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that out of around 180 adults hospitalised with the coronavirus, 89% had at least one underlying condition, with obesity being the most common for those between 18 and 64. Just under a third (29%) of UK adults were classified as obese in 2019. In the US, 42% of people of all ages carried a dangerous amount of weight in 2017/18. Early research suggests the coronavirus is mild in four out of five cases, however, it can trigger a respiratory disease called COVID-19.
